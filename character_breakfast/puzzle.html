<p>Two members per team came to one of two seatings in the Lobdell room in the Stratton Student Center for a character breakfast where they joined with 4 other teams to form tables of 10 people.  Upon entering they had a photo with a character (Kobo the Wolf or Luma the Astronaut), and offered a breakfast spread generously made possible by our sponsor, <a href=https://www.janestreet.com/>Jane Street</a>.</p>

<p>Once everyone was seated the waiters and characters danced around the dining hall holding white napkins.  Players then discovered that the featured entertainment of the breakfast “The Celebrity Chefs!” never showed up and that they would need to help out in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Two people from each table were brought to the stage where they were asked to use a griddle and pancake batter to play Pancake Pictionary to draw Supporting Characters from books, movies and TV shows using pancakes.  Each table of 10 people (and five teams) acted as one team. The two acting “chefs” created pancakes and waiters (played by GC) delivered the cooked pancakes to tables where the rest of the  table would need to guess the character.  Every time a character was correctly identified, the chefs would swap with two players from their table, who became the new chefs.</p>

<p>Photos of some of the best pancakes for each of the 8 characters are below.  As you can see, not many tables made it to character 8:</p>

<h3>Character Photos</h3>
<p>About a half-hour into the breakfast a photographer came by and offered to sell them the framed photo of the table with Kobo that was taken earlier. Each table had to identify 8 characters to earn the photo, although teams who had solved the coupon puzzle only needed 6 identifications:</p>
