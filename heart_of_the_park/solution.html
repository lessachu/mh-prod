<p>There are ten runarounds that can be completed simultaneously by splitting up into small groups.</p>

<h2>The Grand Castle</h2>
<center><img src=assets/image3.jpg width=300></center>
<p>The runaround starts in the lobby of Building 7, as evidenced by the King’s comment about lobbying for a 7th husband.  The path travelled from Building 7 to 9 to 33 and finally to 35.  Each stanza of the dialog between king and queen identified a particular place and a particular word (or words) found in that location.  The king and queen wanted different extractions.  The comments about finding “middle ground” was a clue to take the midpoint of their two letters.</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="5">
	<tr><th>Object/Word</th><th>King’s Letter</th><th>Queen's Letter</th><th>Midpoint of Queen & King</th></tr>
	<tr><td>ADVANCEMENT/DEVELOPMENT</td><td>T</td><td>P</td><td>R</td></tr>
	<tr><td>LIGHTING/ILLUMINATED</td><td>I</td><td>A</td><td>E</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DESIGN/ARCHITECTURE</td><td>I</td><td>E</td><td>G</td></tr>
	<tr><td>JIM/JAMES</td><td>M</td><td>E</td><td>I</td></tr>
	<tr><td>SPACECRAFT/VEHICLE</td><td>A</td><td>E</td><td>C</td></tr>
	<tr><td>GUIDANCE/NAVIGATION</td><td>D</td><td>N</td><td>I</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DOCKING/RENDEZVOUS</td><td>C</td><td>E</td><td>D</td></tr>
	<tr><td>INSTRUCTION/TEACHING</td><td>I</td><td>A</td><td>E</td></tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>Upon completing the above steps, the final step was to locate a four word message on a nearby wall THINK PLAN BUILD CITIES, where the second word (PLAN) was extracted to be prepended to the above word (REGICIDE).  Consequently, the final answer was PLAN REGICIDE.  Entering this into the answer checker informed teams that they needed to recreate their favorite fictional regicide.</p>					


<h2>Storybook Forest</h2>
<center><img src=assets/image2.jpg width=300></center>
<p>As the flavortext states, this runaround “starts” at the small lending library at the corner of Main Street and Ames.  Hunters quickly realize that these directions are actually presented in reverse order, so in fact Hansel and Gretel are ending at the Library, and the solvers should follow the breadcrumbs backwards to the origin of their trip.</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="5">
	<tr><th>Breadcrumb</th><th>Result</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Letter K, shifted by 2</td><td>M</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Fifth from WASSERMAN</td><td>E</td></tr>	
	<tr><td>Fire panel sign</td><td>O</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Course X sign</td><td>P</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Department of Biological Engineering</td><td>E</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Morse code floor tile pattern</td><td>T</td></tr>
	<tr><td>J. T. Dorrance sign</td><td>I</td></tr>
	<tr><td>One.MIT name initial</td><td>C</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Nano lab missing letter</td><td>E</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Micromosaics: Reins</td><td>R</td></tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>Since teams were working backward, they should read the answer in the reverse order to get RECITE POEM.  The final instruction clues the hunters to a nearby sign where they needed to find the fifth word of the second sentence of the largest paragraph (BYZANTINE). Manipulating appropriately gives the word ZANY, so the final answer is RECITE ZANY POEM.   Entering this into the answer checker informed teams that they needed to recite the first two verses of Jabberwocky complete with interpretation.</p>					

<h2>Spaceopolis</h2>
<center><img src=assets/image5.jpg width=300></center>
<p>As could be discerned from the provided photo, teams were to start this runaround on the third floor of Building 7, near room 7-302.  The entire length of this hallway contains small hemispherical models of the planets mounted to the wall; these are referred to as “Control Spheres” in the runaround.  Beneath each sphere is an image of a red sun (at the same scale as icons of each planet) which serve as “Emergency Reset Button”. The runaround consists of various visits to each of these planets, with the extra “twist” that issues with the gravity drive cause the hunter to float and rotate at times so that “up” is not always toward the ceiling of the building.  Keeping careful track of the changing orientation helps to properly interpret the letters seen from the location of each of the ERBs.</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="5">
	<tr><th>Visiting Sequence</th><th>Planet</th><th>Letter Extracted</th></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>Jupiter</td><td>W</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2</td><td>Venus</td><td>O</td></tr>	
	<tr><td>3</td><td>Mercury</td><td>M</td></tr>
	<tr><td>4</td><td>Saturn</td><td>A</td></tr>
	<tr><td>5</td><td>Mars</td><td>N</td></tr>
	<tr><td>6</td><td>Uranus</td><td>L</td></tr>
	<tr><td>7</td><td>Earth</td><td>O</td></tr>
	<tr><td>8</td><td>Neptune</td><td>K</td></tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>Reordering these in the order of the planets’ proximity to the sun gives the phrase MOONWALK.  Following the instructions in the final paragraph leads solvers to a plaque seen through a glass wall.  Extracting the second and third words from the last line of the third paragraph gives DEPICT THE, so the final answer is DEPICT THE MOONWALK.  Entering this into the answer checker informed teams that they needed to moonwalk from one end of the room to the other.</p>


<h2>Wizard's Hollow</h2>
<center><img src=assets/image10.jpg width=300></center>
<p>The first step is to realize that the entire runaround takes place on a statue called “The Alchemist” found on the MIT campus. Follow one continuous path from one symbol to the next, taking the letter (or a letter that looks the most like the math symbol) where instructed.</p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding="5">
	<tr><th>

	<tr><td>E to the C</td><td>This is your 5th</td><td>C</td></tr>
	<tr><td>SE to the 1</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<p>The final solution is MAGIC TUNE. Entering this into the answer checker informed teams that they needed to sing a song listing Harry Potter characters to the tune of Modern Major General.</p>	



<h2>Yesterdayland</h2>

<p>The provided picture shows a barely discernible du Pont Court, which implies that the gold star is in the halls of Building 1 close to the intersection of Building 3.  A little hunting finds the following posters on the wall of one of the floors depicting timelines of impactful milestones for a variety of MIT course tracks, as seen in the photo below.</p>

<center><img src=assets/image12.jpg width=500></center>

<p>Looking at the text, solvers should be able to match various snippets with milestones of a particular year.  Each paragraph indicated two separate years within the same course.  Transporting from one paragraph to the next was equivalent to transporting from a milestone to another milestone with an identical year in a different course.  From there, two new milestones were found.  This process continued until the end. The text near the end of the puzzle indicated you “could just shift your times forward based on each of the courses you took? You might need to wrap sometimes. Oh, and don’t forget to put things in order, of course!”  This implied that you should add the course number to the duration of time between the two years found, and take that result modulo 26 to get a letter.  This should be read in course order for the final message.  The data looked essentially like the following:</p>

<center>
<table cellpadding="5">
	<tr><th>Teleport Year</th><th>First Milestone Year</th><th>Second Milestone Year</th><th>Course</th><th>(Second-First+Course) mod 26)</th><th>Letter</th></tr>
	<tr><td>1865</td><td>1972</td><td>1984</td><td>3</td><td>15</td><td>O</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1984</td><td>2000</td><td>2004</td><td>16</td><td>20</td><td>T</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2004</td><td>1960</td><td>1961</td><td>20</td><td>21</td><td>U</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1961</td><td>1916</td><td>1929</td><td>2</td><td>15</td><td>O</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1929</td><td>1931</td><td>1938</td><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>H</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1938</td><td>1985</td><td>2010</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>I</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2010</td><td>1955</td><td>1975</td><td>22</td><td>16</td><td>P</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1975</td><td>1959</td><td>1969</td><td>6</td><td>16</td><td>P</td></tr>
	</table>
</center>
<p>Ordering by Course number gives the answer HOOP IT UP.  Entering this into the answer checker informed teams that they needed to twirl a hula hoop for 30 seconds.</p>


<h2>Big Top Carnival</h2>

<center><img src=assets/image7.jpg width=500></center>

<p>Teams started in the Stata parking garage, and followed the described path for the tiny clown car, which can easily drive up stairs and through doorways! At each “clown’s house” location, one particular clown name made the most sense. Using the number indicated by the large X, teams indexed into the clown’s name to get one letter per location. At the end of the journey, teams also found one item and took the full word, giving the final answer phrase ELEPHANT IMPRESSION.</p>

<center>
<table cellpadding="5">
	<tr><th>location</th><th>whole number</th><th>index number</th><th>clown name</th><th>letter</th></tr>
	<tr><td>P1 Elevator Service Room</td><td>32-0057</td><td>5</td><td>MR.OTIS</td><td>I</td></tr>
	<tr><td>MIT Hacks Fire Hydrant</td><td>(1971-1980)</td><td>1</td><td>MR.DOUSEFIRE</td><td>M</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Police Car</td><td>253-1212</td><td>2</td><td>SPEEDY</td><td>P</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Escher Sketch</td><td>1988</td><td>8</td><td>SKETCHER</td><td>R</td></tr>
	<tr><td>Professor Wolfgang Kettrle lab, Atomic Quantum Gasses Group</td><td>2016</td><td>6</td><td>GASSIE</td><td>E</td></tr>
