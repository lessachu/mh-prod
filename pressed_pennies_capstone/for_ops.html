<h2>Hints:</h2>

(aha: this puzzle uses rules from the game Rush Hour, with a slight variant on how the whale moves)
<ul>
  <li>NUDGE: The grid and the boats may remind of you of a particular board game involving congestion.</li>
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: The boats (and the goal of the game) follow the rules of the game Rush Hour with the whale replacing the red car.  Rush Hour is pretty straightforward, but the instructions can be found <a href=https://www.thinkfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/RushH-5000-IN02.pdf>here</a> if needed.</li>
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Each board has a single unique solution to get the whale into the open sea in the fewest number of whale moves possible</li>
</ul>

(aha: Counting the number of whale moves gives you one of the answers)
<ul>
 <li>NUDGE: Make sure you are moving the whale off the board in the fewest number of moves possible!</li>
 <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Converting the number of whale moves per board to a letter should get you one of the final answers.</li>
</ul>

(aha: Track the kids that Willy jumps over and their position on the sea wall to get the second answer)
<ul>
	<li>NUDGE: Think back to the famous scene in Free Willy linked in the instructions</li>
	<li>NUDGE: Willy jumps over at least one wall in each of grids.</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: For each wall that Willy jumps over, note the name of the kid on the wall.</li>
	<li>NUDGE: The position of the kid on each sea wall is also important.</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Index into the name of each kid that Willy jumps over based on his or her position on the sea wall to get another answer</li>
</ul>
