 <p>Solvers are presented with a sequence of 22 professional sports team logos. Each of them is circular, but the entirety of the image has been blacked out except for one wedge. The wedge is always placed in exactly the same position relative to the properly oriented logo, but then the images have been rotated. The rotations result in each wedge pointing at one of the 12 hours on a clock face. Take those numbers as an index into the team name.</p>
    <p>In order, they are:</p>

    <p>(As it happens, this uses ALL of the circular sports team logos from the four major American leagues except for the Oakland Aâ€™s, the Washington Wizards, and the Philadelphia 76ers. The Calgary Flames logo isnâ€™t quite circular, but itâ€™s the closest one whose team name has an F in it.)</p>

    <p>Apply the same mask used in the puzzle to the circular area of
the drawing, in the same position as it was applied to each properly
      oriented logo. That results in this image:</p>
