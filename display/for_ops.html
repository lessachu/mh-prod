<h2>Hints:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ignore the colors for now.
  <li>All of the triplets can be re-arranged to form lines (with a little extra) from a Scottish play.
  <li>As the extra letters indicate, you should apply the colors to a color checker that shares a name with a famous Scottish play.
  <li>Index each text color to a letter, using the Macbeth ColorChecker
