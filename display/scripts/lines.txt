Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has
Let not light see my black and deep desires: 
Stop up the access and passage to remorse, 
Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
But screw your courage to the sticking-place, 
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: 
Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more! 
Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason! 
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late; 
Double, double toil and trouble; 
Young fry of treachery!
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful, 
To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate: 
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed: 
What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug, 
Let every soldier hew him down a bough 
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.
But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn, 
I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
