<h2>Hints:</h2>

(aha: You can combine emojis to form the themes or titles of books by the authors listed at the top)
<ul>
	<li>NUDGE: You should be looking to create two emoji sequences.</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: You can combine two of the emojis in the top grid to form the title of a book that corresponds to an author that is currently on loan.  For instance, the üêñ and the üï∏Ô∏è combine for Charlotte's Web, by E. B. White.</li>
</ul>

(aha: Use zappar, use the zap code and then scan the room numbers for each of the rooms given by the authors on loan)
<ul>
	<li>NUDGE: You might want to browse the Authors of the library collection first.</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: The first letters of the Authors of the library collection will spell out your next steps.</li>
	<li>NUDGE: You'll need to download zappar and use the zap code.  Once that's done, you'll need to scan something related to our authors currently on loan.</li>
	<li>NUDGE: You need to be REALLY CLOSE to the plaque.  Once you've found the authors, look around!</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Scanning each room number plaque will genearate a sequence of emoji in zappar that you'll use for the next step of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

(aha: Each of the emoji sequences in zappar correspond to a book written by an author in the library)
<ul>
	<li>NUDGE: The emoji sequences in zappar feel very literary to me.</li>
	<li>NUDGE: Each emoji sequence is related to an author in the library.</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Each of the emoji sequences in zappar refers to a book.  For instance, at room 56-114, you can find ü§∫ü§∫ü§∫, which clues Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas.  Each book is written by an author in the library.
</ul>  


(aha: Clicking on the author's last name in the library will give you a 10x10 grid of 1s and 0s, arranging each section according to the virtual position of the emoji sequence in zappar will create an image of a volleyball )

<ul>
	<li>NUDGE: That's a lot of 1s and 0s, are you sure you're looking at them in the right way?</li>
	<li>NUDGE: Did you note where the emoji sequences in zappar were located?</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Assemble all the 1s and 0s according to where the emoji sequences in zappar are located relative to each other. You should get a 4x4 grid.</li>
	<li>NUDGE: Your final data forms an image.</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: It's a picture of something round used in sports.</li>
</ul>
