is an array of 12 coats of arms of Swiss cantons. There are exactly
26 Swiss cantons. They have a definitive constitutional order. 
</p>

<p>
Some sources are a little squidgy on the order because, a few times, two cantons were formed by splitting one canton in half, so they entered simultaneously. But there is an order. The full Wikipedia page “Data Codes for Switzerland” has the proper order, though there seems to be a mobile bug that switches a couple of lines in the chart. The best source is the Swiss Cantonal Tree (thus the “tree” reference in the flavor text). Here’s an image:<br>

The cantons start with #1 in the upper left and read left-to-right, top-to-bottom, as you’d expect.

Here’s one in Berne, Indiana:<br>

This one has the same cantons in the same order, but the orientation is different. It reads down by columns, instead of across by rows. Silly British.

<p>
Map the cantons to letters as follows:

<table>
 <tr> <td> Lucerne <td> 3 <td> C
 <tr> <td> Zürich <td> 1 <td> A
 <tr> <td> Appenzell Ausserrhoden <td> 16 <td> P
 <tr> <td> Grisons <td> 18 <td> R
 <tr> <td> Zug <td> 9 <td> I
 <tr> <td> Fribourg <td> 10 <td> J
 <tr> <td> Zürich <td> 1 <td> A
 <tr> <td> Uri <td> 4 <td> D
 <tr> <td> Schwyz <td> 5 <td> E
 <tr> <td> Aargau <td> 19 <td> S
 <tr> <td> Schwyz <td> 5 <td> E
 <tr> <td> Nidwalden <td> 7 <td> G
</table>

  The image yields the message CAPRIJADESEG, meant to be parsed as the clue “Capri Jades, <i>e.g.</i>” (fitting in the blanks).
  Capri Jades are CIGARETTES.
