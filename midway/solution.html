<h3>Elimination Match</h3>
<p>The underlying picture is actually a red herring - literally, a picture of two red herrings. Players must instead focus on the symbols, 2 of which don’t actually have a match (unique). Those 2 symbols are a COAT and a TAIL. Joined together, they give the answer word COATTAIL.</p>

<h3>Ring Around the Bottle</h3>


<h3>Ball In the Bowl</h3>
<p>Each slip of paper hold the name of a company who has sponsored a Bowl game and an enumeration that matches the name of Bowl game that they sponsored. Taking the final number as an index into that city yields the word VERY:</p> 

<center>
	<table cellpadding=5>
		<tr><th>Bowl Color</th><th>Paper Text</th><th>Bowl Game</th><th>Indexed Letter</th></tr>
		<tr><td>red</td><td>MITSUBISHI 3 5 [4]</td><td>LAS VEGAS</td><td>V</td></tr>
		<tr><td>orange</td><td>NEW ERA 9[9]</td><td>PINSTRIPE</td><td>E</td></tr>	
		<tr><td>yellow</td><td>CAPITAL ONE 6 [2]</td><td>ORANGE</td><td>R</td></tr>	
		<tr><td>green</td><td>AUTOZONE 7 [7]</td><td>LIBERTY</td><td>Y</td></tr>			
	</table>
</center>  

<p>But we're not done yet!  To get the final answer, we have to remember, "What's the name of the game?"  The game is "Ball In the Bowl" and so, we add BALL into VERY to get VERBALLY.</p>

<h3>Open Range</h3>

<p>Each of the blocks has an item pictured on it, but when the block is knocked over it reveals a different object. Players must realize they’ve “opened” the first item to reveal what was inside of it. When they take the first letter of each revealed (“inside”) object, they spell a word:</p>

<center>
	<table cellpadding=5>
		<tr><th>Initial Item</th><th>Inside Item</th><th>First Letter</th></tr>
		<tr><td>CIRCUS TENT</td><td>ELEPHANT</td><td>E</td></tr>
		<tr><td>HOSPITAL</td><td>NURSE</td><td>N</td></tr>
		<tr><td>DINOSAUR EGG</td><td>VELOCIRAPTOR</td><td>V</td></tr>
		<tr><td>CHICKEN</td><td>EGG</td><td>E</td></tr>
		<tr><td>BOTTLE</td><td>LIGHTNING</td><td>L</td></tr>
		<tr><td>ROWBOAT</td><td>OAR</td><td>O</td></tr>
		<tr><td>OYSTER</td><td>PEARL</td><td>P</td></tr>
		<tr><td>CORAL</td><td>EEL</td><td>E</td></tr>
	</table>
</center>

<p>The first letters of the inside items spell ENVELOPE, but as with the other booths, we now have to apply the name of the booth, so we open our envelope to get our final answer: LETTER.</p>

<h3>Gone Fishin'</h3>



<h3>Upside Down Croquet</h3>
<p>The key to this puzzle (in addition to managing to hit all the targets, which was quite tricky) is realizing that all the ‘beginning’ words can all have the same letter put at the start to make a new word, ‘middle’ words can all have the same letter placed into the middle to make a new word, and ‘end’ words can have the same letter placed at the end to make a new word:</p>

<center>
	<font color=#A50707 size=5>
<table cellspacing=5>
	<tr><td colspan=3 align=center>?</td>
		<td colspan=3 align=center>?</td>
		<td colspan=3 align=center>?</td></tr>
	<tr><td colspan=3 align=center><img src=assets/upside1.svg width=200></td>
		<td colspan=3 align=center><img src=assets/upside1.svg width=200></td>
		<td colspan=3 align=center><img src=assets/upside1.svg width=175></td></tr>
	<tr><td align=center>beginning</td>
		<td align=center>beginning</td>
		<td align=center>beginning</td>
		<td align=center>middle</td>
		<td align=center>middle</td>
		<td align=center>middle</td>
		<td align=center>end</td>
		<td align=center>end</td>
		<td align=center>end</td></tr>
	<tr><td align=center>(a)corn</td>
		<td align=center>(a)lone</td>
		<td align=center>(a)void</td>
		<td align=center>mo(n)th</td>
		<td align=center>pe(n)al</td>
		<td align=center>so(n)ar</td>
		<td align=center>ever(y)</td>
		<td align=center>grim(y)</td>
		<td align=center>scar(y)</td></tr>
</table>	
</font>
</center>

<p>Taken together, those three letters form a word: any. But, as with all the other games, we need to apply the title of the game - so turn lowercase (notice that all the signage is deliberately lowercase) "any" upside down to get the answer: HUE</p>


<h3>Midway Meta</h3>
<p>Fun fact: the rubik's cubes were originally used in the finale of the <a href=http://www.miskatonicuniversitygame.com/>Miskatonic University Game</a> before finding a second life as Midway prizes in the 2020 Mystery Hunt.</p>

<p>To solve the Midway meta, solvers needed all the answers to the Midway games.</p>
