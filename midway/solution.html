<h3>Elimination Match</h3>
<p>The underlying picture is actually a red herring - literally, a picture of two red herrings. Players must instead focus on the symbols, 2 of which don’t actually have a match (unique). Those 2 symbols are a COAT and a TAIL. Joined together, they give the answer word COATTAIL.</p>

<h3>Ring Around the Bottle</h3>


<h3>Ball Into the Bowl</h3>

<h3>Open Range</h3>

<h3>Gone Fishin'</h3>

<h3>Upside Down Croquet</h3>
<p>The key to this puzzle (in addition to managing to hit all the targets, which was quite tricky) is realizing that all the ‘beginning’ words can all have the same letter put at the start to make a new word, ‘middle’ words can all have the same letter placed into the middle to make a new word, and ‘end’ words can have the same letter placed at the end to make a new word:</p>

	<tr><td align=center>(a)corn</td>
		<td align=center>(a)lone</td>
		<td align=center>(a)void</td>
		<td align=center>mo(n)th</td>
		<td align=center>pe(n)al</td>
		<td align=center>so(n)ar</td>
		<td align=center>ever(y)</td>
		<td align=center>grim(y)</td>
		<td align=center>scar(y)</td></tr>
</table>	
</font>
</center>

<p>Taken together, those three letters form a word: any. But, as with all the other games, we need to apply the title of the game - so turn lowercase (notice that all the signage is deliberately lowercase) "any" upside down to get the answer: HUE</p>


<h3>Midway Meta</h3>
<p>Fun fact: the rubik's cubes were originally used in the finale of the <a href=http://www.miskatonicuniversitygame.com/>Miskatonic University Game</a> before finding a second life as Midway prizes in the 2020 Mystery Hunt.</p>

<p>To solve the Midway meta, solvers needed all the answers to the Midway games.</p>
