	<p class="flavor">Our sheep can count on having mega baa-d dreams of robot encounters; it no longer knows whether it&#39;s man or beast&hellip;</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411; I got distracted by the pleasant music and the big fish enemy with the light! Water in the boss&#39;s room made things tricky, but I exploited his weakness by using my serrated circular weapon faultlessly.</p>
	<p>&#x1f411; This foe had a graceful blue form, wielded a long melee weapon, and could sometimes cause fish to appear. After winning, I got a &quot;Laser&quot; weapon&mdash;a type that&#39;s time-honored!</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411; I looked toward the upper right to select this stage, and had to contend with hard hat enemies and oil that could be set ablaze. The boss must have found his wind weakness rather inopportune!</p>

	<p>&#x1f411; Up and up, jumping between platforms with rotating hazards... the final foe had a green and yellow-orangeish color scheme, and the battle took place against a dark sky. He could generate wind columns that spun around and around, but I triumphed and picked up the usual thingamabob.</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411; I had to jump between moving transports (and deal with a miniboss menacing me from the left) before reaching this ferociously clawed boss with a spiky yellow mane. When I saw the pink glow, I make sure to dodge the subsequent charge attack&mdash;it all but disembowels!</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411; This industrial factory featured conveyor belts (often not going in the direction I wanted!) and crushers&mdash;I had to take my time to make it to this steelworker!</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411; I started outdoors, descended into tunnels, and then emerged back into the open&mdash;I had to watch out for snow-lobbing enemies! I avoided contact with the dangerous temporary ice that the boss created, and exploited his fire weakness. I shouldn&#39;t have let the little smile in his portrait give me heartthrobs.</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411; This time, I had to jump over lava, sometimes waiting for vertical columns to be free of hot obstacles, before reaching the fireball-spewing boss and snuffing him with a wind weapon. A battle with a flame dragon is always treacherous!</p>

	<p>&#x1f411; When this orange fella wasn&#39;t jumping around, he was releasing multiple shocking discharges at once. After all, you can&#39;t spell his name with out &quot;MAN&quot;, so in his intro, of course he had to pose in a macho way with his arms up, tastelessly.</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411; This foe with distinctive head protrusions released dangerous arcs of projectiles, as well as balls that could follow me and lock on. I also dealt with a room-encircling miniboss and blew a bunch of crates to smithereens.</p>

	<p>&#x1f411; I navigated through outdoor and indoor regions before reaching a boss area that featured a cloudy sky backdrop and a large purple region. To dodge the hovering enemy&#39;s spinning air blades, I had to move around like a speedskater.</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411; I had to jump between a series of ramps, without much time to linger! After a two-part stage, crushing footsteps announced the arrival of the boss. He could create large frozen masses, and when he used a certain attack, I had to watch for falling ice! He was a huge round galoot with big arms&mdash;what a lickspittle.</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411; I chose the center boss in the top row. In his stage, I kept having to change my idea of which way was up&mdash;at least I had some control over it!&mdash;and of course there were some spikes. I was rewarded with a purple outfit after defeating the boss&mdash;I had to keep careful track of his whereabouts!</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411; This round guy had big feet for sliding, distinctive headgear, and no obvious mouth. I avoided the flying orange propeller-headed orbs in his slippery stage and picked up an optional energy tank (but it was an easy fight, so that wasn&#39;t exactly make-or-break).</p>

	<p>&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411;&#x1f411; I got distracted by the ethereal music and glistening gem colors. I enjoyed the light blue color scheme I picked up after beating the boss... but he shot out multiple bluish globs, and took some outsmarting!</p>
