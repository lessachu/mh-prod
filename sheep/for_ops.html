<h2>Hints:</h2>

(aha: the excerpts are describing fights with Mega Man bosses / parts of their stages)
<ul>
  <li>NUDGE: All of these excerpts relate a popular franchise (a video game franchise to be specific)
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: All of these excerpts related to Mega Man and describe either fights or parts of their stages.
</ul>

(aha: the excerpts each clue TWO bosses, one in Mega Man and one in Mega Man X)
<ul>
	<li>NUDGE: These excerpts are worded pretty generally and you may find that it's impossible to pick only one boss for each.
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Each is written in a general enough way that it simultaneously describes a Mega Man boss (Robot Master) and a Mega Man X boss (Maverick)
	<li>NUDGE: The two bosses clues in each excerpt will have something in common.
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: The names of the Mega Man Robot Master and the Mega Man X Maverick in question have the same first word, e.g. Chill Man and Chill Penguin (this dramatically cuts down on the search space -- all fifteen currently existing overlaps are used)
</ul>

(aha: index to get the answer phrases)
<ul>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Indexing into the words like Chill by the number of sheep gives USE THE LAST WORDS. 
	<li>NUDGE: The last word of every blurb is 11 letters long.
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: The extraction for the last word is: take the number of the game (Mega Man 1 through 11, or Mega Man X 1 through X 8) and index into that word. For example, Chill Man is from Mega Man 10 and Chill Penguin is from Mega Man X 1, so "heartthrobs" yields a B for the Robot Masters' message, and an H for the Mavericks' message.
</ul>
