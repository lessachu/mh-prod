<h2>Hints:</h2>

(aha: The images represent 11 pairs of household objects seen from two different views)
<ul>
	<li>NUDGE: You've probably seen these things before, say, around the house</li>
	<li>SLEDGEHAMMER: There are 11 pairs of household objects here seen from two different views.</li>
</ul>

(aha: To extract the final answer, make a crossword of the object names in the grid and use the dollhouse steps to find what letters to extract)
<ul>
  <li>NUDGE: Fill out the grid before you use the footsteps.</li>
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: The grid can form a criss-cross if you put the ﬁrst letter of each object you ﬁnd in the square of its associated room.  For example, the square marked DINING ROOM is the T in TEACUP and TEACUP should read down.</li>
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Overlap the footprints for each object onto the grid and read out the red squares to spell the solution.</li>
</ul>
