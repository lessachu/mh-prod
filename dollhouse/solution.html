<h2>How to Solve</h2>

<p>These are common household objects viewed from 2 angles each. The 11 objects are:</p>
<p>
HAIR DRYER, MUFFIN TIN, WATERING CAN, NOTEBOOK, LAMP, DENTAL FLOSS, IRONING BOARD, TEACUP, ALARM CLOCK, BROOM, and MAILBOX.
</p>

<p>For each object, there's an associated room:<br>
1. Dining Room - TEACUP<br>
2. Vanity Room - HAIR DRYER<br>
3. Living Room - LAMP<br>
4. Kitchen - MUFFIN TIN<br>
5. Study - NOTEBOOK<br>
6. Bathroom - DENTAL FLOSS<br>
7. Garden - WATERING CAN<br>
8. Bedroom - ALARM CLOCK<br>
9. Closet - BROOM<br>
10. Laundry Room - IRONING BOARD<br>
11. Front Yard - MAILBOX

<p>
You can fit the names of the objects into the grid by putting the first letter of the object into its associated room square and forming a criss-cross. The complete grid is below. If you arrange the footprint squares correctly on the names of their objects, the footprints can make a single path through all 11 objects. Hitting the red squares spells out HALF SECTION.
