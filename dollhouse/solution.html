<h2>How to Solve</h2>

<p>These are common household objects viewed from 2 angles each. The 11 objects are:
</p>
<p>
HAIR DRYER, MUFFIN TIN, WATERING CAN, NOTEBOOK, LAMP, DENTAL FLOSS, IRONING BOARD, TEACUP, ALARM CLOCK, BROOM, and MAILBOX.
</p>
<o>
You can fit the names of the objects into the grid by putting the first letter of the object into its associated room square and forming a criss-cross. The complete grid is below. If you arrange the footprint squares correctly on the names of their objects, the footprints can make a single path through all 11 objects. Hitting the red squares spells out HALF SECTION.
