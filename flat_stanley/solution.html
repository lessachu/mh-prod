<h2>How to Solve</h2>

<p>Each Flat Stanley doll is a depiction of Stan Lee in one of his famous cameo roles in a Marvel movie.  Identify each movie and then match the right accessory with that movie depending upon the context of the scene (some details of the costumes were left off such as military hats to make the IDing slightly more challenging).  Index by the accessory price into the movie title (in order of Stan Lee dolls) to get the phrase FRENCH MAGAZINE CHARLIE, which references the comic satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, so the answer is HEBDO.
