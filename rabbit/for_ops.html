<h2>Hints:</h2>

(aha: Each clue solves to a number, which helps to determine what each rabbit is named)
<ul>
  <li>NUDGE: Match each rabbit with its name!</li>
  <li>NUDGE: Each clue should definitively point to a number</li>
 </ul>

(aha: The carrot can be interpreted two ways, as an exponent operator or XOR operator)
 <ul>
  <li>NUDGE: Have a lot numbers but don't know what to do?  What sounds like carrot?</li>
  <li>NUDGE: If the math isn't working out, consider the first letter of each of the leftmost clues</li>
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Mod everything by 26 first, before applying a caret operation</li>
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: A caret can either be an exponent operator or a bitwise XOR operator.  You'll need to use both for this clue</li>
</ul>
