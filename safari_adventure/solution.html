  You need the Tiger puzzle answers.
</p>

<p>
  There's no Tiger puzzle; but there's a Tiger answer for each Safari "keeper" mini-meta puzzle.
  By solving these mini-meta puzzles, you can "back-solve" the corresponding tiger answers.
</p>

<p>
  The Tiger answers are all words and phrases from William Blake's poem "The Tyger,"
  popularly known as "Tyger Tyger". The "line" in the flavortext means you want the
  line numbers those words appear in. <i>E.g.</i>, BURNT is in the 6th line, which
  yields the letter&nbsp;F. Order these in keeper-order:
</p>

<table>
<tr> <th> Keeper <th> Word       <th> Line# </tr>  
<tr> <td> Zeus  <td> BURNT	     <td> 6	<th> F
<tr> <td> Jack  <td> FEET	     <td> 12	<th> L
<tr> <td> The Astrologer <td> DISTANT    <td> 5	<th> E
<tr> <td> The Captain <td> SEIZE	     <td> 8	<th> H
<tr> <td> Sam   <td> CHAIN	     <td> 13	<th> M

This extracts the solution, FLEHMEN LIPS.
Not to be confused with a certain band, this refers to a scary-looking tiger behavior that is fearful to the park's guests!
