<h2>How to Solve</h2>

<p>Five of the answers to this round’s puzzles are 11 letters long, and the other three are 9 letters long. They can interlock into a symmetrical crossword, as clued by “cross” in the puzzle’s text.</p>

<p>Once the grid is assembled, the answer FURRY TAILS can be read from the rows (or columns, depending on your grid orientation) where you would expect two more 9-letter answers to appear to make a complete grid.</p>
