<h2>Hints:</h2>

(aha: the quotes are from actors that have all been in Disney movies together - white hats are good guys, black hats are bad guys)

<ul>
  <li>NUDGE: Start with identifying each quote. The movie, precise quote and character name is not necessary information for each sound byte.  
  <li>NUDGE: Once you've identified each actor speaking in the sound byte, the trick is to pair together the folks on the left column with the folks on the right. Who would duel who (and why)?  
  <li>NUDGE: Where might these folks may have worked together?
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: The puzzle contains fourteen pairs of actors who were good guys and bad guys in Disney films.  To help you identify the film, the left column is listed alphabetically by film name.
</ul>

(aha: once you've paired each bad guy and each good guy, they form semaphore letters that give the final message)

<ul>
  <li>NUDGE: Now that you have pairs of good and bad guys, how might they go together?
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Once you've paired all the good guys and bad guys, super-impose the corresponding white hat and black hatted cowboys to get the final message.
</ul>

(aha: the final message refers to Patrick Warburton's role as Puddy in Seinfeld)

<ul>
  <li>NUDGE: Who plays Puddy?
  <li>SLEDGEHAMMER: Patrick Warburton plays Puddy in Seinfeld. Who does he play in the Disneyverse?
