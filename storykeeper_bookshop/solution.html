  The puzzle video shows Penny in a bookshop, shelving books.
  The books' jackets have prominent titles.
  After putting the books in this order, Penny asks
  “How am I going to find the time to draw those new illustrations?”
</p>

<p>The book titles are:

<ul>
 <li> Cuddly Ogres
 <li> Vampire Entourage
 <li> Retired Fairies
 <li> Owl Reading
 <li> Magical Elves
</ul>

<p>The initials of the book titles, in order, spell COVER FOR ME,
  which fit in the provided blanks nicely.

<p>Teams who entered this were instructed to visit guest services.
  There, they received a big piece of paper and instructions to create
  a piece of art depicting something in particular.
  (These artworks later were part of the Character Breakfast event.)
  Turning in the piece
  of art was rewarded with Penny's thank-you note containing
  the puzzle's solution: SORRY I'M LATE.
