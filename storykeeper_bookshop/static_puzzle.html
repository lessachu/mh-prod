  <p>Teams who solved the above puzzle were instructed to visit guest services.
  There, they received a big piece of paper and instructions to create
    a piece of art depicting something in particular.
    (These artworks later were part of the <a href=http://pennypark.fun/puzzle/character_breakfast/>Character Breakfast event</a>.)
    Turning in the piece
  of art was rewarded with the puzzle's solution.</p>
